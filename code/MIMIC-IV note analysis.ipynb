    "Clinical notes vary considerably in their level of detail and thoroughness. A provider may include more detail to provide context for a patient to read. Alternatively, they may omit details to avoid confusing or upsetting the patient. To test our hypothesis of how OpenNotes impacted the specificity of the text, we use the following language measures: 1) Note length. Increased note length may be associated with additional details, and previous studies found that the length of Oncology progress notes increased34. We will automatically remove Copy-Forward portions of notes45. We will use the Evaluate Metric Python library46 from Hugging Face to identify (close to) exact matches with a probability threshold of 0.8, where 1 means the two texts are identical. Additionally, we will measure the length of each note section separately in our analysis (e.g. subjective, objective assessment, plan). 2) Novelty. Notes that contain information similar to prior notes (e.g. copy-forward) may contain fewer details of the clinical encounter. Redundancy will be measured by finding duplicated text across records. We will measure new information through the variation in words in a note, using Shannon entropy, compared to average variations between subsequent patient encounters."
