Notes:
1. IRB status: only non-human subject now
2. MIMIC IV data: pre and post open note (2021), primary care and mental health
create pipeline -> pull in note, get free text, cleaning of the data
3. Phenotype the MIMIC population. Use ICD code to understand the diagnosis distribution. 
ICD-10 codes: mood disorder, including major depression (F32*, F33*), bipolar disorder (F25.0, F30*, F31*), persistent mood disorder (F34*), eating disorder (F50*), or schizophrenia (F20*) + internal medicine. Can use data from different domains.
4. Cloud server: https://researchit.jhu.edu/research-hpc/
5. Future challenge: How to evaluate change in sensitive topics, tones, etcâ€¦

Questions: 
1. Time range for MIMIC-IV (2011-2019). When did Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center adopt Open Notes? (https://www.opennotes.org/institution/beth-israel-deaconess-medical-center/)
2. Whether there is progress notes? If yes, focus on that. 

To do:
1. Create git repo (completed)
2. Use BigQuery or other tools to access MIMIC data. (https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/blob/main/mimic-iv/buildmimic/bigquery/README.md)
Report the data: eg. number of words (tokens), # of unique tokens
Tokenization: use spacy (https://spacy.io) or medspacy (https://github.com/medspacy/medspacy)
3. Check time range for MIMIC-IV (2011-2019). Notice that they added some new data in the lastest version.
4. Send emails to ask about the time range for MIMIC-IV. Get access to HPC from Hopkins.
